[1] What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists drive technological innovation and keep current technology running smoothly so as to not interfere with our daily lives/functions.

[2] How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Once a problem has been identified, it is important that we use our skill sets and available resources to determine how to most efficiently solve a 
problem in a lasting manner. 

[3] What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

In this course, we learned about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines. These help to protect the end user from potential harm and 
the organization from liability issues. It is imperitive that we aim to protect the end user from potential biases, harm or data breaches. It is also 
important that we are protecting our employers from liability issues and data breaches/vulnerabilities.
